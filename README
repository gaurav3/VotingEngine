Project structure:
------------------
This project allows anonymous voting amongst a network of windows user. This consists of four parts:
1. Voting Client - The names and icons -in .png format- can be provided in the config file of this project
2. Voting Service - This is a wcf service that needs to be hosted in IIS. This is to be configured to have a value (0-1.0) associated with each one of the above states. The user heirarchy is also configured in this project using user.xml.
3. Voting Results Heatmap - This project allows connecting with the Voting service to fetch the voting data and generate and rectangular heatmap. Each segment can be clicked to see further details of the sub-teams.
4. Common - Common classes used across multiple projects mentioned above.

Possible uses:
--------------
This can be used for any sort of anonymous voting within an organization. Possible examples could be:
1. Monitoring the happiness level of various teams in realtime. This can be tied together with project phases and status reports and can serve as an important factor.
2. To monitor the general sentiment on any issue that affects the entire organization.
3. To monitor market sentiment on any stock, sector, country, currency etc. If taken from a good sample set this can serve as a good indicator.

Features:
---------
1. The login id is automatically detected so that one user is allowed to vote only once from whichever machine.
2. The voting is completely anonymous as the login Id is never shown with the results. It's only displayed as the team level average.
3. A user can change his vote whenever he desires which is recorded as a state change nullifying the users last vote. So this automatically reflects in the new results accordingly.
